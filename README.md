# parses - methods for running different AllenNLP classifiers
# prepare_ROC.py - does everything involved with reading, selecting, and editing ROCStories
# process - bloated, but contains methods to run, evaluate, and print WinoGrad examples
#
# Note that the formatted winograd/ROCStories files aren't included here since they're too big,
# so these programs won't work as is
